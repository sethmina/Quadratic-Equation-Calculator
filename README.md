# Quadratic Equation Calculator

This is a C# program that solves quadratic equations. The program uses the quadratic formula to solve the equations. This program is my own original idea, and I coded it myself. I am putting it on GitHub so that other people can use it and learn from it.
Here are some of the features of the program:
•	It can solve quadratic equations with real or complex roots.
•	It is written in C#, so it can be run on any platform that supports C#. 
I hope you find this program useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.
